    The ideal study tool  
  </div>

  <div>
    Life is too complicated to prepare beforehand a calendar of what to study and follow it accordingly
    Yet we want some control and balance over the subjects we study
    What really matters is that we know what to do next
    What to do next cannot be a "must follow" only an advice
    It's better to study in many little sessions than in few big one's
    We want to study a lot of things and there are subjects more important than others (and their importance change quite often)
  </div>

  <div>
    create a new subject
    mark when you study it
    get a new most prioritized
  </div>
